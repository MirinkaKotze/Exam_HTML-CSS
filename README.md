Beetroot Academy Exam - HTML and CSS

Main rules:

You will have 6 hours and the teacher will check your work time by the first and last commit time, so be careful. You can communicate with each other, use the internet, post on Stack Overflow but neither teacher nor code mentors can help you.

Exam criteria:

Valid HTML/CSS (no errors, warnings, etc)

Semantic markup (nav, navigation as a list, section for section, etc)

Everything should look in accordance with the design (fonts, colors, background, borders, shadows, border-radiuses, etc). The exception: large margins, padding, width, height are not allowed.

Use normalize.css/reset.css

Use Google Fonts, Font Awesome

All interactive elements should have hover and/or focus styling

Add Favicon to the website

Use Sass

It should look similar/same in Chrome, Firefox

It should be responsive

The form should have a validation

Completeness: it's better to have all sections created with some imperfections than one perfect section. On the other hand, it's better to have one perfect section than the whole website that is a total mess. So you need to find balance and create the whole website
